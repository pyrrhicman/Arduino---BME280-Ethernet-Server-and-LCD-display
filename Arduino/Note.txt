6.2.1 I²C write Writing is done by sending the slave address in
 write mode (RW = ‘0’), resulting in slave address
 111011X0 (‘X’ is determined by state of SDO pin. 
Then the master sends pairs of register addresses and register data. 
The transaction is ended by a stop condition. This is depicted in Figure 9.  
 

6.2.2 I²C read To be able to read registers, first the register address 
must be sent in write mode (slave address 111011X0). Then either a stop
 or a repeated start condition must be generated. After this the slave
 is addressed in read mode (RW = ‘1’) at address 111011X1, after which
 the slave sends out data from auto-incremented register addresses until
 a NOACKM and stop condition occurs. This is depicted in Figure 10, where
 register 0xF6 and 0xF7 are read.
